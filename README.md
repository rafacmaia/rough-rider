The web app no one's been waiting for is here, no more scrambling for pen and
paper and wasting precious cabin time with convoluted tournament systems when
you just want to get a bit Rough with your fellow Riders.
The **Rough Rider App** takes care of it all so you can just relax and throw
some darts at beer cans the way you were meant to.

The app manages team selection, tournament setup, score tracking, and player &
team stats. Built with React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, and Firebase.

## 🪑 What is Rough Rider?

**Rough Rider** (also known as *Beer Darts* in less professional settings) is a
game of
mysterious origins consisting of teams of 2 players
sitting opposite each other, roughly 4-5 meters apart, and taking turns
throwing darts at each
opposing
player's canned drink of choice. The team that pierces their opponent's two
cans
first takes the win.
